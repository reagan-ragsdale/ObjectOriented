# ObjectOriented
Object Oriented Project (C++)
I took the builder style and gutted it to build different planets gravities with your weight as well as how much you can lift and it shows the differences on each planet. 
This project can have many improvements added on. The two main ones I would like to add on are getting and input for how much you weigh as well as how much you can lift and also being able to take the original inputs and changing them in the different planet classes with the different gravity types.
